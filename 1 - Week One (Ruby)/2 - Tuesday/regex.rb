# Ruby's String class has over 100 public methods that give Ruby programmers a remarkable power to process, manipulate, and transform textual data. About a dozen of those String methods use Regular Expressions in order to allow for high-powered string matching.

# An example of low-powered string matching is when you use your browser's search (âŒ˜f on a Mac) for a specific word, say, your own name. What if you wanted to search your browser for anything that matches the pattern for a social security number? For that, you'd use Regular Expressions.

# As you work through the exercises of this challenge, we recommend you use http://rubular.com to help you code your regex. Refer to the Pickaxe Guide or this overview if you get stuck!

# Objectives
# Use the driver code in the gist to guide you to a working solution.
# Add additional driver code where you want to feel more comfortable with your implementation. For instance, what happens when you pass a string with only a single SSN into the hide_all_ssns or get_all_ssns methods?
# Did adding driver code helped you solve the challenge more effectively? How? (Answer in the gist as a comment)
