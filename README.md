Progression
===========
Description
-
This repository chronicles my progression in programming skills over a nine-week period.  I started this journey
knowing literally nothing about programming and ended the journey a web developer.

The code is far from perfect, but the purpose here is not to show off; the purpose is to record what is possible
in nine weeks.  This repository also serves as a reminder of how I learned my first programming language, Ruby, and
therefore, how I may better learn my next.
