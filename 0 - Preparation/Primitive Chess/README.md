<h1>Ruby Chess</h1>

<p>A primitive Ruby program for playing 2-player chess in the terminal.  The program can<\n>
validate pieces to ensure that you are actually moving a piece and that you are not moving<\n>
your opponents' pieces, but the program relies on users to know the rules of chess.  Castling, <\n>
check, and checkmate have not yet been implemented, nor have the 20- or 50-move rules.  There <\n>
is no 'save' feature nor any way to undo a move yet.  Users must exit with 'ctrl+c'.</p>
